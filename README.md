# Creating Dataframes & Altering Columns in Python

This project provides a structured flow for Dataframe alteration. By the end of the project, the users will understand creating columns (default and calculated), concatenating, Appending, Renaming and Reording in Python. The users will practice using Pandas library.

> Note: This is a practice project and can be used for the academic purposes of learning python.

## Getting Started

We will be using **Python** for the application of the attached code, the user is expected to have the software installed in their local device. 


### Prerequisites

- Python software
  - Pandas library installation
- Salaries.csv ([Click Here](https://durhamcollege.desire2learn.com/d2l/le/content/431600/viewContent/5651932/View) to download)
- Lab4_Week7.ipynb ([Click Here](https://github.com/devarora25/data1202/blob/devarora25-v1.0.0/Lab4_Week7.ipynb) to download)

### Installing

<ol>
  <li> Go to the Anaconda website for downloads - https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual (the Anaconda installers will be near the bottom of the page)</li>
  <li> Download the appropriate latest version of Anaconda (64-bit graphical installer for Python 3.8 version)</li>
  <li> After your install is complete, verify it by opening Anaconda Navigator:
  <ul>
    <li> On a Windows PC, from the start menu, select Anaconda3(64-bit), then select Anaconda Navigator. If Navigator opens, you have successfully installed Anaconda.</li>
    <li> On a Mac, open Finder and then Applications. Launch the Anaconda-Navigator.app. If Navigator opens, you have successfully installed Anaconda.</li></ul></li>
  <li> Now close the Anaconda Navigator application</li>
  
 <br>
 
**Python Libraries Install**

  <li> Launch Command Prompt
<ul>
  <li>Windows PC open the Anaconda Prompt (start menu under Anaconda3(64-bit))</li>
  <li> Mac users launch the Terminal App (open Finder under Applications then go to Utilities folder).</li></ul></li>
  <li>Enter the following commands one at time and wait for each install to complete running.
    <ul>
      <li> pip install numpy</li>
      <li> pip install pandas-profiling</li></ul></li>
  <li>Close the Anaconda Prompt/Terminal App</li></ol>


## Running the Project

To run the project the user is expected to download the [Lab4_Week7.ipynb](https://github.com/devarora25/data1202/blob/devarora25-v1.0.0/Lab4_Week7.ipynb) file. Once downloaded, you may perform the following steps to run the project:


### Starting Python
- Open Anaconda3(64-bit) software.
- Home screen would appear with a number of applications. Launch "Notebook (Jupyter)" from it.
- On clicking a tab would appear on your default browser with your local files.
- Go to the loaction where the Salaries.csv file is saved. Double click on the file.
- The file will open up in Jupyter Notebook environment on your brownser.

### Project Flow
The project is segmented into three following parts:
1. [Create new columns](https://github.com/devarora25/data1202/edit/devarora25-v1.0.0/README.md#1-create-new-columns)
2. [Concatenate dataframes and Append Data](https://github.com/devarora25/data1202/edit/devarora25-v1.0.0/README.md#2-concatenate-dataframes-and-append-data)
3. [Rename and Reorder of Columns](https://github.com/devarora25/data1202/edit/devarora25-v1.0.0/README.md#3-rename-and-reorder-of-columns)

> Each part covers a specific topic and provided the code to implement the same in an oderly fashion

#### 1. Create new columns
The following topics, along with their codes are covered under this section:
- Creating a column with a default value
- Creating a column with a calulated value
- Dropping a column, by:
  - including specific columns
  - excluding specific columns

#### 2. Concatenate dataframes and Append Data
The following topics, along with their codes are covered under this section:
- Creating a list or new column in a dataframe
- Combining various lists of a dataframe

#### 3. Rename and Reorder of Columns
The following topics, along with their codes are covered under this section:
- Changing of column names 
- Reordering of columns

## Deployment

The users are not required to perform any specific steps for the code deployment. The users can download the attached file, open it in Jypter Notebook on Anaconda, and run the code to fetch the necessary results.
